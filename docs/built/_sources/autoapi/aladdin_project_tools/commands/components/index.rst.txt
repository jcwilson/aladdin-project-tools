.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Commands for working with the project's components.

   Once you ``poetry install`` this project, you can invoke these commands at the command line.

.. function:: main(ctx: typer.Context, log_level: LogLevel = typer.Option(LogLevel.INFO, help='Set the Python logger log level for this command.'))

   Commands for working with the project's components.



   :param ctx: The typer invocation context.
   :param log_level: The Python logger log level for this command.


.. function:: validate(components: List[Component] = typer.Argument(None))

   Validate the components' component.yaml files.

   :param components: The components to validate, default is all of them.


.. function:: create(name: pathlib.Path = typer.Argument(None), component_type: ComponentType = typer.Option(ComponentType.Standard, hidden=True, prompt=textwrap.dedent("\n            What kind of component do you wish to create?\n\n            1) Standard - An aladdin component where most of the boilerplate is taken\n                          care of for you already.

   Add a new component to the project.



   :param name: The name of the new component.


.. function:: build(components: List[Component] = typer.Argument(None))

   Build the docker images for the project's components.

   This will also perform validation on the components before attempting the build, too.



   .. note::
       This command is essentially ``aladdin build``, but is present here if one is more
       comfortable using ``component`` commands to interact with this project.

   :param components: The list of components to build. If none provided, all components will be
                      built.

   **Examples:**

   .. code-block:: shell
       :caption: Build all components

       $ components build --log-level DEBUG

   .. code-block:: shell
       :caption: Build only the shared and api components

       $ components build --log-level DEBUG shared api


.. function:: run(component: Component, command: List[str] = typer.Argument(None))

   Run a command in a component's container.

   This will mount the components/ directory in the container.

   This doesn't precisely run the actual component's image, as oftentimes one will wish to
   have an ENTRYPOINT and CMD already baked into the image. This runs an image with the sole
   difference being that the ENTRYPOINT and CMD settings have been cleared. This gives us the
   flexbility to get in and explore the container without compromising the image intended to be
   published.



   :param component: The component container to run.
   :param command: Any remaining arguments will be passed to the container as its ``run`` command,
                   defaults to ``/bin/bash``.

                   .. important:: If these arguments contain ``-`` or ``--`` flags, you will need
                                  to preface this argument list with ``--``.

   **Examples:**

   .. code-block:: shell
       :caption: Run the default CMD for the ``pipeline-flake8`` container

       $ components run pipeline-flake8

   .. code-block:: shell
       :caption: Run a specific CMD for the ``pipeline`` container

       $ components run pipeline prospector

   .. code-block:: shell
       :caption: Run a specific CMD with complex arguments for the ``pipeline`` container

       $ components run pipeline -- black --check --diff --target-version py38 .


.. function:: edit(component: Component)

   Run the editor container for the specified component.

   This facilitates editing the poetry dependencies in the container that requires them. It assumes
   the image uses poetry to manage its python dependencies.

   This will mount the components/ directory in the container, but place you in the component's
   specific directory to start.

   If the poetry.lock file is changed, this will then rebuild this component and any components
   that depend upon it.



   :param component: The component whose dependencies you wish to edit.

   **Example:**

   .. code-block:: shell
       :caption: Start a bash shell in the /code/api directory of the api container

       $ components edit api
